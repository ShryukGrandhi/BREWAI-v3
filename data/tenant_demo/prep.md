## Cooking Standards

### Wings
- **Par Cook**: 10 minutes at 375°F until 165°F internal
- **Finish Cook**: 3-4 minutes for crispy skin
- **Sauce**: Toss immediately in sauce bowl
- **Plating**: 6, 10, or 20 piece portions

### Tenders
- **Breading**: Flour → buttermilk → seasoned breading
- **Cook Time**: 6-8 minutes at 350°F until 165°F internal
- **Rest**: 1 minute before plating

- **Onion Rings**: 2-3 minutes at 350°F
- **Mac & Cheese**: Heat in steam table, portion 8 oz servings

## Weather Considerations

### Rainy Days
- **Increase wing prep by 15%** - customers order more comfort food
- **Extra sauce prep** - buffalo and garlic parmesan are top sellers in rain
- **Ensure delivery supplies** - bags, containers, extra napkins
- **Check heating elements** - food must stay hot during delivery

### Hot Days
- **Lighter sauces** - lemon pepper and honey BBQ sell better
- **Increase coleslaw prep** - refreshing side is popular
- **Ice water for celery** - keep extra crisp
- **Monitor refrigeration** - more door opening in busy times

## Inventory Management

### Daily Count (6:00 PM)
- Count remaining wings (raw and cooked)
- Check sauce levels
- Verify side prep quantities
- Note any shortages for next day order

### Order Guidelines
- **Wings**: 12 wings per order average
- **Reorder point**: When inventory falls below 200 lbs
- **Par levels**: 
  - Wings: 300 lbs frozen, 50 lbs thawed
  - Fries: 100 lbs
  - Sauces: 2 gallons each flavor

### Waste Reduction
- Use FIFO (first in, first out) for all ingredients
- Repurpose extra wings in wraps or salads
- Track waste daily to identify patterns
- Adjust prep quantities based on day of week and weather
