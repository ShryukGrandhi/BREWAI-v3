- **Flexible staffing**: Some staff may not be able to come in
- **Plan for closures**: Cross-train staff on all positions

## Weather-Based Forecasting Formula

### Order Volume Adjustment
Base forecast from historical data, then apply weather multipliers:

**Rain (>60% probability):**
- Delivery: Base × 1.30
- Dine-in: Base × 0.85
- **Overall: Base × 1.15**

**Heavy Rain/Storm (>80% probability):**
- Delivery: Base × 1.45
- Dine-in: Base × 0.75
- **Overall: Base × 1.25**

**Hot (>85°F):**
- Overall: Base × 0.95 (slight decrease in appetite)
- Beverage: Base × 1.30

**Cold (<40°F):**
- Overall: Base × 1.05
- Hot sides: Base × 1.20

**Snow/Ice:**
- If light (<3 inches): Base × 0.80
- If heavy (>3 inches): Base × 0.50 or close

### Staffing Calculation
1. Calculate adjusted order forecast
2. **Orders per cook per hour = 25** (standard capacity)
3. **Required cooks = Forecasted Orders / 25** (round up)
4. Add 1 extra cook during uncertain weather for buffer

### Inventory Calculation
1. **Base wings per order = 12** (average)
2. Multiply by adjusted order forecast
3. Add weather buffer (15% for rain, 10% general buffer)
4. **Total wings needed = (Orders × 12) × (1 + weather_buffer)**
5. Remember prep time: Thaw 2 hours, prep 30 minutes

## Real-Time Adjustments

### Monitor Throughout Day
- **Check weather updates** every 2 hours
- **Track actual vs. forecast orders** to adjust on the fly
- **Communication**: Alert staff if conditions changing
- **Flexibility**: Be ready to call in backup or send staff home

### Emergency Contacts
- Staff phone tree for weather closures
- Supplier emergency contacts
- General Manager and Owner on speed dial
- Local news/weather alerts enabled

## Historical Data

### Past Rain Events
- **March 15, 2024**: Heavy rain, 35% volume increase, needed 4 cooks instead of 3
- **July 8, 2024**: Thunderstorm, delivery orders up 40%, ran out of buffalo sauce
- **October 22, 2024**: All-day rain, 28% increase, perfect staffing with +1 cook
